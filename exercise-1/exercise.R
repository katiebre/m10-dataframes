# Exercise 2: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored the first 4 games of last season
# Hint: (google "Seahawks scores 2016")
seahawk.scores <-c(12,9,37,27)

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have allowed to be scored against them in the first 4 games
scores.against <- c(10,3,18,17)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
my.data<-data.frame(seahawk.scores, scores.against)

# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points
veiw(my.data.frame)

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks wom


# Create a vector of the opponents


# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
